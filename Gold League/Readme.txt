I did not win this one. Time for this part : 9H. Total : 15H
The principle is the same as the previous league, except the shield is activated when close enough a pod and after a while the pod which is behind attacks the enemy pod which is winning

-I changed the avoidance because the previous version was too "avoiding" but I'm not sure if it is better
-the shield behavior is basic, it is activated if we are moving fast enough (because we won't be able to accelerate after that) and not in 1st laps
-we anticipate a bit the next checkpoint (search for "ANTICIPATE") if we are moving fast enough to the current checkpoint
-handle_attack (which should have been private) tries to attack the best enemy
